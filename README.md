📋 Survey Form – Front-End Web Project

The Survey Form project is a simple and responsive web application built using **HTML and CSS**, designed to collect user feedback in a structured and user-friendly manner.

This project focuses on creating well-organized form layouts, proper use of input types, labels, and basic validation to improve usability and accessibility. It helped strengthen my understanding of HTML forms, styling techniques, and responsive design principles.
